My KiCad Custom Libraries
=========================

The things of general interest in the symbol library could be:

* THAT Corp 1240 Series Line Receiver 
* Don Audio RM8 series multi tap transformer


The other stuff is rather specific, I might clean up the rotary switch symbols later.


Footprints include:

* Don Audio RM8 series multi tap transformer
* LORLIN CK series of rotary switches
* NKK M2T22 DP3T switch

The KCZ 4 to 11  throw multi level rotary switch is based on highly unreliable
online schematics, don't use it yet.
