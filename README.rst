My KiCad Custom Libraries
=========================

The things of general interest in the symbol library could be:

* THAT Corp 1240 Series Line Receiver 
* Don Audio RM8 series multi tap transformer


The other stuff is rather specific, I might clean up the rotary switch symbols later.


Footprints are based on spec sheets so far:

* LORLIN CK series of rotary switches (untested IRL)
* NKK M2T22 DP3T switch (untested IRL)
* NKK D2 series of switches (untested IRL)

The KCZ 4 to 11  throw multi level rotary switch is based on highly unreliable
online schematics, don't use it yet.
The Don Audio RM8 series multi tap transformer is even more tentative, and
I'm just using it as a placeholder ATM.
